# Kyber FPR Node Implementation

Kyber FPRs allows professional MMs to either manually or build bots to operate their own unique algorithms, customize their trading strategy, and adjust their desired risk exposure. This is a reference implementation for Kyber's FPR javascript SDK. 

We recommend reviewing the following basic walkthrough to get a good understanding of the key ideas. By default, it connects to Ropsten testnet, but you can easily point it to mainnet when you are ready to deploy. 

- [Walkthrough 1: Deployment, Adding Token Pairs and Setting Rates](docs/walkthrough1.md)
- [Walkthrough 2: Controlling Rates](docs/walkthrough2.md)
- [Mainnet Staging Guide](docs/mainnetStaging.md)

More advanced walkthroughs, including how to use step functions to simulate orderbooks, sanity rates to improve fund safety, and advanced concepts like replacing transactions will be added shortly.
