# Kyber FPR Node Implementation

Kyber FPRs allows professional MMs to either manually or build bots to operate their own unique algorithms, customize their trading strategy, and adjust their desired risk exposure. 

This is a reference implementation for Kyber's FPR javascript SDK. By default, it connects to Ropsten testnet, but you can easily point it to mainnet when you are ready to deploy. 

We recommend reviewing the following walkthroughs to get a good understanding of the key ideas.
